# News Site: Casa Sur news
https://casasurnews.netlify.app/

First website achieved!
It has been a long and hard journey. Full of ups and downs. But It has come to light.
The assignment is to create a News site. It doesn't have to be serious, just believable.
I chose to make it about events happening on the area. So I came up with the idea of "Cultural events in Skane with a Latin American stamp".
I also chose it to belong to "Casa Sur", which is an organization that organizes events of this kind.
I started by drawing on paper the design and elements I wanted in my website. Then I tried to copy it.
The header was the first set of elements to create, then the body and the footer. I googled many of the ideas that I used in my desing, as it is my first one so I needed the inspiration.
The time I used to finish this project was nearly 2 months. I think I was a lot to work with, but I am grateful to have this time to practise.
